# ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer built using Python Tkinter. It helps structure focused work sessions with short and long breaks using a clean, easy-on-the-eyes interface.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Python`
- `Tkinter`

## 🚀 Features

- Work, short break, and long break cycles
- Automatic session switching
- Visual countdown timer
- Session completion checkmarks
- Clean, pastel-themed UI

## 📍 The Process

This project was built as **Day 28 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course and builds on the Tkinter fundamentals learned on Day 27.

The focus was on understanding how Python handles dynamic typing and how variable values can change over time during program execution. Using this concept, the timer dynamically updates the countdown, session state, and UI elements.

The project also reinforced working with Tkinter’s event loop, timers using `after()`, and managing application state across multiple functions. Care was taken to keep the interface minimal and visually calm to make it comfortable for longer focus sessions.
